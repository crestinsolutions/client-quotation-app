git clone --YOUR_OLD_GIT_URL

cd quotation-generator.git

git remote set-url --push origin NEW_REPO_URL

git push --mirror



Part 2: Deploying to the New Render Account
Now that your code is in the new repository, we can deploy it.

Step 1: Create a New Web Service on Render
Log in to your new Render account.

From the dashboard, click New + > Web Service.

Connect your new GitHub account to this Render account.

Select the new repository you just created (quotation-generator).

Step 2: Configure the Service Settings
Fill out the deployment form with the following details:

Name: A unique name for your application (e.g., my-new-quote-app).

Runtime: Node

Build Command: npm install

Start Command: node app.js

Instance Type: Free

Step 3: Add Environment Variables
Before creating the service, scroll down to the Advanced section. You must add all your secret keys here.

Click Add Environment Variable for each of the following keys and paste the corresponding value from your local .env file.

NODE_ENV: production

MONGO_URI: Your MongoDB connection string.

SESSION_SECRET: A long, random string for sessions.

GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID: Your Client ID from Google Cloud.

GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET: Your Client Secret from Google Cloud.

EMAIL_HOST: Your SMTP server address.

EMAIL_PORT: The port for your email server (e.g., 587).

EMAIL_USER: Your email username.

EMAIL_PASS: Your email password or App Password.

EMAIL_FROM: The email address you want to send from.

For now, skip FRONTEND_URL and GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI. We will add them in the final step.

Step 4: Deploy and Finalize Configuration
Click Create Web Service. Render will start the first deployment.

Once the deployment is live (or has finished its first attempt), copy the URL for your new service provided by Render at the top of the page (e.g., https://my-new-quote-app.onrender.com).

Update Environment Variables in Render:

Go back to the Environment tab for your new service.

Add the FRONTEND_URL variable, pasting your new Render URL as the value.

Add the GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI variable, pasting your new URL followed by the callback path: https://my-new-quote-app.onrender.com/auth/google/callback.

Save the changes. This will automatically trigger a new deployment.

Update Google Cloud Console:

Go to the Google Cloud Console.

Navigate to your project > APIs & Services > Credentials.

Click on your OAuth 2.0 Client ID.

Under Authorized redirect URIs, click + ADD URI.

Add your new redirect URI (https://my-new-quote-app.onrender.com/auth/google/callback).

Click Save.
